# IMPORTANT INITIAL OPEN SOURCE RELEASE NOTE

The contents of this repository differ slightly from the source used to build
the distributable downloads.

The reason for this is that we currently did not have the time to split out
some refereces to some private infrastructure and servers. Regardless of these
minor differences everything in the github repository should build and work as
expected.

The code will be modified to allow the differences to be configurable at build
time, some public CI service will be configured as well in a not to distant
future.
